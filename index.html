            <h1>butterfly creek</h1>
            <p>Butterfly creek is a game I've been developing for a couple months now.
        
            <p>it's an adventure/puzzle RPG, heavily inspired by the likes of <img src="deltarune_logo.png" height=15px></img> and <img src="undertale_logo.png" height=12px></img>.</p>

            <p>There's more frequent updates on my <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/butterfly-creek">tumblr blog</a></a>
            <p>you can also follow the project on <a href="https://i-am-controlled-by-cats.itch.io/butterfly-creek">itch.io</a></p>


            <h1>government shutdown clock</h1>
            <p>after seeing the *terrible* webdesign of the offical shutdown clock for the 2025 US government shutdown, i decided to speedrun making my own. i made this in roughly an hour and half. i don't plan on taking it down after the shutdown ends, but maybe i'll change the text.</p>
            <p>check it out <a href="shutdownclock/">here</a></p>

            <h1>LTD100 (learning to draw in 100 days)</h1>
            <p>i've largely quit this, although it's still definitely somethign i plan on revisiting. essentially i just try to draw every day for 100 days. i stopped at roughly day 20 due to a combonation of apathy and life getting in the way.</p>

            <h1>this website</h1>
            <p>yes yes i know, i'm very meta.</p>
            <p>honestly i just made this website because i got really bored, and figured it might be fun to create</p>
